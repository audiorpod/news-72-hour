# Responsive Dashboard with News and Payout Features

Responsibilities:
1. User Authentication:
○ Implement secure login functionality using email-password authentication or
third-party tools (e.g., Google, GitHub OAuth).

2. News and Blog Data Integration:
○ Fetch data from free third-party news APIs (e.g., News API, Guardian API).
○ Display article/blog counts with details like author, date, and type.
3. Filtering and Search:
○ Implement filters to allow users to search by:
■ Author
■ Date range
■ Type (e.g., news, blogs)
○ Add a global search bar for quick keyword searches.
4. Responsive Design:
○ Build a fully responsive UI compatible with both mobile and desktop devices.
5. Payout Calculator:
○ Allow admins to set a payout per article/blog value.
○ Store payout data in local storage.
○ Automatically calculate total payouts based on the number of articles/blogs
and their rates.
6. Export Functionality:
○ Enable users to export payout reports as:
■ PDF
■ CSV
■ Google Sheets integration.
7. Frontend Frameworks & Tools:
○ Use modern frameworks like NextJs for development.
○ Ensure proper state management using tools like Redux, Pinia, or Context
API.

Key Features to Implement:
1. Dashboard:
○ Overview of total articles/blogs fetched from the API.
○ Visual representation of payouts and filters.
2. News Analytics:
○ Graphical charts (e.g., bar, pie, or line charts) showing article trends by author
or type.
3. Payout Details:
○ A simple table listing authors, articles, and calculated payouts.
○ Inline editing for payout rates.
4. Export Options:
○ Export filtered or complete data in PDF/CSV/Google Sheets format.
5. Error Handling:
○ Graceful fallback for API failures (e.g., display a message if the news API is
unreachable).

Technical Skills Required:
● Frontend Frameworks: React.js, Next.js,
● APIs and Integration: Fetching and handling data from third-party REST APIs.
● Responsive Design: Expertise in building mobile-first, responsive UIs using CSS or
frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
● State Management: Redux, Recoil or Context API.

Bonus Points:
● Implementing offline mode with IndexedDB or localStorage.
● Incorporating dark mode for the dashboard.
● Ensuring high Lighthouse scores for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
